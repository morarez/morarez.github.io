Platform Engineer with extensive experience in both cloud-native and on-premise infrastructure environments. Specializing in Kubernetes and AWS, I architect and implement scalable, automated platform solutions that enable development teams to deploy and manage applications efficiently across hybrid environments.

## Areas of Expertise

- **Container Technologies**: Advanced experience with Kubernetes, including cluster management, deployment strategies, and operational excellence
- **Cloud Infrastructure**: Extensive experience with AWS services (EKS, ECS, EC2, VPC) and infrastructure as code using Terraform and AWS CDK
- **Platform Engineering**: Building developer-centric platforms with automated workflows, GitOps practices, and self-service capabilities for both cloud and on-premise environments
- **DevOps & Automation**: Implementing robust CI/CD pipelines, monitoring solutions, and security practices using tools like ArgoCD, Jenkins, and GitHub Actions

I'm passionate about creating efficient infrastructure solutions that combine technical excellence with practical automation, enabling teams to focus on building great products rather than managing infrastructure, regardless of the deployment environment.
